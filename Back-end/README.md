## BlogApp Back-end

Back-end for BlogApp apps, latest modification in 2015.

At the time I had 17-18 years old and I was learning PHP by myself for about one year, so don't care about the coding standards used here, because I didn't know about most of PHP functions, like `json_encode` 😂

The apps data is mainly a wrapper to the Blogger API.
